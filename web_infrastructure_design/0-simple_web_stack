Server: A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. In theory, whenever computers share resources with client machines they are considered servers.

Domain name

Domain Name: The domain name is the address where Internet users can access your website. In this case, foobar.com is the domain name.
DNS Record: www in www.foobar.com is a type of DNS record known as a CNAME (Canonical Name). CNAME records can be used to alias one name to another.

Web server

Web Server (Nginx): The role of the web server is to accept incoming requests for webpages (HTTP/HTTPS requests) and serve the webpage content to the user’s browser for rendering.

Application server

Application Server: The application server runs your code. It could be a Python interpreter for a Django application, a Ruby interpreter for a Rails application, or a Node.js runtime for a JavaScript application, etc.
Application Files: These are the actual codebase for your website. This could be written in any number of languages like Python, Ruby, JavaScript, etc.

Database

Database (MySQL): The database is where you store your site’s dynamic data so it can be retrieved and served in response to HTTP requests.
The server communicates with the user’s computer using the HTTP/HTTPS protocol.

However, there are some potential issues with this infrastructure:


Single point of failure

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): If the single server goes down, the entire website goes down.
Maintenance Downtime: When deploying new code, the web server often needs to be restarted, causing downtime.
Scalability: If there’s too much incoming traffic, a single server will not be able to handle the load. This setup does not allow for easy horizontal scaling (adding more servers).
This is a very basic setup and may not be suitable for larger, high-traffic websites, but it’s a good starting point for smaller projects and for learning about web infrastructure.
